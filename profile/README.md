## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

MachineHub is inventing new AI agents that will augment software engineering teams. These agents are designed to be fully autonomous and collaborate with other agents and engineers. They can implement a project given high level purpose and requirements. 

## Rivet
This is our MVP repo where our agents are actively working on implmeneting an S3 Object Storage system using Go.

## Agent Elle
Elle is our most advanced agent with higher level reasoning. Given a purpose, she lays out a project plan and implementation steps to execute. She ensures the project adheres to high level objectives and requirements

## Agent Space Pi
Space Pi is our cost effective model. She is adept at reading and writing code with a current focus on Go. She also solves bugs and compilation issues. While being cost effective, she saves money by not using a high level reasoning model for coding tasks.
